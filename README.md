This repository showcases Tableau visualizations created using multiple datasets. Tableau1 explores global video game sales through two datasets: `vgsales.csv.xlsx` and `directory.csv`, highlighting trends by platform, genre, and publisher. The workbook `Tableau1.twb` integrates these via data joins for interactive dashboards. Tableau2 focuses on employee and department data using `Joins Files (Tableau2 data table).xlsx`, with insights built in `Tableau2.twb`. These projects demonstrate proficiency in Tableau's join operations, dashboard design, and data storytelling. Ideal for viewers interested in real-world Tableau applications across sales and organizational datasets.
